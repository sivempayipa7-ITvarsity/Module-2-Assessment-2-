                 <h3>PEP STORES</h3>
                 <P>Pep has launched a brand refresh which will be rolled out systematically across 2 350+ stores over the next few years through the reallocation of existing budgets. The clothing retailer was launched in 1965 in De Aar and says it is the biggest single-brand retailer in Africa. The new ID was created by Superunion Africa, a division of Ogilvy South Africa.</P>
